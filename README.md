## About this project
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

## Data description
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

## Data Source: Where Our Data Comes from 
Data imported from the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv

## Main goals
The purpose of the analysis was to find out which factors influence customers' tipping behavior such as gender, smoking habits, day of the week...

# Results
General conclusion 
1. Smokers tend to tip more than non-smokers. However, the difference is not significant.
2. More people visit the restaurant on Thursday and Sunday. However, the average tip values among days of week are not much different.
3. Males tip more frequently than females.
4. There are more people come to the restaurants for dinner. However, the average tip values between lunch and dinner are not much different, either.
